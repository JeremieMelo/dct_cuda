# CUDA implementation of discrete cosine transform (DCT)
src/dct are imported from DREAMPlace
https://github.com/limbo018/DREAMPlace.
Other files are developed by Jiaqi Gu and Zixuan Jiang.
This implmentation is integrated into the DREAMPlace.

# Transforms
* 1d/2d DCT
* 1d/2d IDCT
* IDCT_IDXST
* IDXST_IDCT

# Algorithms
* Naive methods. Directly compute the DCT according to the definition.
* Leeâ€™s Algorithm. The proposed algorithm in the paper is recursive. We have implemented the iterative version, which is more friendly to GPU.
